# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project is part of my Summer Training (Angaar Batch, LPU) and demonstrates end-to-end **sales analysis** of a pizza store using **SQL for data querying** and **Excel for dashboard creation**.


## 📦 Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on 4 structured CSV files:

- `orders.csv`: Contains order date and time
- `order_details.csv`: Links each order to a specific pizza and quantity
- `pizzas.csv`: Details pizza IDs, size, and prices
- `pizza_types.csv`: Contains full names, categories, and ingredients


## 🔧 Tools Used

- **MySQL** – to store data and perform SQL analysis
- **Excel** – for data visualization and dashboard creation


## 🧠 Key Questions Answered

- Total orders and total revenue generated
- Most frequently ordered pizzas
- Top revenue-generating pizzas
- Monthly trends in orders and revenue
- Day-wise (weekly) performance
- Category-wise sales breakdown (Veggie, Chicken, Classic, etc.)


## 📊 Dashboard Features (Excel)

- KPI Cards (Total Orders, Revenue, Pizzas Sold)
- Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)
- Weekly Revenue by Day (Bar Chart)
- Top 5 Best-Selling & Revenue Pizzas (Column Charts)
- Sales by Category (Donut Chart)


## 📝 SQL Skills Demonstrated

- Joins across multiple tables
- Grouping and aggregation (`SUM`, `COUNT`)
- Use of `DATE_FORMAT()`, `DAYNAME()`
- Calculated fields (`quantity * price`)
- Order trends and insights using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`


## 🧠 Learnings & Outcome

This project helped me connect SQL with Excel, perform real-world business analysis, and tell a story using visual data insights. It was a valuable exercise in combining raw data with analytical thinking.
